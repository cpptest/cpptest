--------------------------------
Maintenance release. Added a more flexible way of handling the 
pkg-config file.

Release 1.0.4 -- December 12 2007

- 'configure.ac' changes
  - Changed '--enable-doc' to be set to 'no' by default.

    the configuration process.
  - Removed '--enabled-debug'.
  - Added '--enable-warnings'.

Release 1.0.2 -- July 8 2004

Release 1.0.1 -- February 5 2004
--------------------------------
- Added a Microsoft Studio .NET project/solution that compiles both the 
  library and the test program.
